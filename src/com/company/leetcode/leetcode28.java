/**
What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().
 * 
 class Solution {
    public int strStr(String haystack, String needle) {       
        return haystack.indexOf(needle);
    }
}
